**Author:** Don Branson

## Abstract

Accurately describing cell imaging is critical for medical diagnostics and research. This paper presents the development and evaluation of lightweight Vision-Language Models (VLMs) specifically designed for medical and life sciences applications. Our approach integrates advanced techniques such as prompt tuning, multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), BitsAndBytes quantization, and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enhance model performance on medical-specific datasets. We evaluate our method using key metrics including description accuracy, generation time, and user satisfaction. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting the potential of lightweight VLMs to transform cell imaging analysis.
